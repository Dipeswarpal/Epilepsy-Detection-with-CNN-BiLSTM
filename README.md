# Epileptic Seizure Detection using CNN + BiLSTM

---

##  Overview

This project focuses on detecting epileptic seizures using a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers. The model is trained on EEG signal data from the publicly available Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset.

##  How It Works

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- EEG signal data with 178 features per instance.
- Dataset is loaded, reshaped, normalized, and split into train and test sets.

### 2. **CNN + BiLSTM Architecture**
- **CNN Layers**: Extract local temporal features from EEG signals.
- **BiLSTM Layer**: Capture bidirectional temporal dependencies.
- **Dense Layers**: Perform final classification into 5 output classes.
- Model Architecture:

### 3. **Training & Evaluation**
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Evaluation is done using test accuracy, confusion matrix, and plots of training history.
